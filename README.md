## TO DO

[ ] - for the love of god reformat and fix todo.txt


<br>

### Things of possible interest

- npm module <b>0MQ</b> for messaging patterns, instead of using plain socket communication

- MIT vs ISC vs Apache 2.0 license for code within website/applications related to site?
> Though ISC is the default license produced by npm init, the MIT license is<br>
> quite popular in the Node.js community. If you plan to publish your module<br>
> on npm and you want widespread adoption, MIT is a good choice.<br>
><br>
> Another popular license, preferred by many companies, is the Apache 2.0<br>
> license. If you use Apache 2, remember to apply the boilerplate notice<br>
> clause in a comment at the top of each source code file.<br>
>
> If none of these suit your fancy, you can browse the Open Source<br>
> Initiative’s alphabetical list.[26] Or if you prefer, you can set license<br>
> to the string UNLICENSED to indicate specifically that there is no license.<br>
> But if you do, know that you’re signalling to the community that they<br>
> should not use your module.
